- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Clemmie @clemmierose. I'm a full stack developer who began programming journey back in 2021 as a self taught web developer and fell in love with software engineering so much I went on to complete a Master of Science in Computing and enjoyed every bit of it!
- I make cool apps with Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React and React Native with the last two being my absolute favorites :D
- ðŸ‘€ I like the idea of using Data Science and Machine Learning to enhance usability and automate features 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning and Python as well as data vizualization techniques. 
- Let me know if you're interested in collaborating :)
